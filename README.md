# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using popular Python libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. The goal is to explore the dataset, understand its structure, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.

## Objectives

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Explore data characteristics such as shape, missing values, and data types.
3. Analyze statistical distributions and relationships among features.
4. Identify and visualize correlations and outliers.
5. Generate insightful visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python** (Version 3.x)
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and exploration.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.

## Steps

1. **Dataset Selection**  
   Start by selecting a dataset which is uploaded
   

3. **Data Loading**  
   Use pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame and inspect its structure.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Check the shape of the dataset, missing values, and data types.
   - Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Analyze distributions of numeric features using histograms.
   - Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots.
   - Use a heatmap to visualize correlations.

5. **Handling Outliers**  
   Detect and visualize outliers using box plots or other suitable methods.

6. **Visualization**  
   Use matplotlib and seaborn to create:
   - Histograms for univariate analysis.
   - Scatter plots for bivariate analysis.
   - Heatmaps to highlight correlations.

## Example Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
